Hi! My name is Xigang Huang, I graduated with a Master of Science in Information Systems Technology at George Washington University. I've been studying data analysis since my undergraduate and have done 4 major analytical experiences among various industry backgrounds, for example, being an analyst intern at an online course start-up and at the ASPIRA ACADEMY. I'm fascinated by numbers and have a strong desire to use data to assist in business decision-making. Recently, I am actively seeking an entry-mid level data analyst full-time position. Please don't hesitate to reach out with any opportunities at [My Email](mailto:huangxigang@gwu.edu).
