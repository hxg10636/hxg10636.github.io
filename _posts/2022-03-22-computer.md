title: Update GPU's Cooling System

### Buying a new RTX3090
I discovered last week that the GPU's temperature remains high even when the computer is in standby mode. After resolving the issues with the water cooling system and fan air duct, I believe it is time to replace the GPU's thermal grease.    

I started replacing it immediately after getting a new GPU thermal patch and thermal pad from Bestbuy!
